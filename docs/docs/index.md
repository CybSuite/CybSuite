# CybSuite

## Introduction

**CybSuite** is a set of tools for security assessments and automation. It is actively under development and currently includes the following tools:

- [**cybs-Review**](review/introduction.md): A framework for configuration review, now supporting Windows systems for hardening and privilege escalation (privesc). Support for Linux and cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure and AWS) is planned.
- [**CyberDB**](cyberdb/introduction.md): An extensible database designed to store all security-related information. While primarily used by Arguard, it can also store penetration test data, configuration reviews, vulnerabilities, and more.

## Future Plans

CybSuite is still in development, with future updates planned to include more plugins for configuration review, additional privilege escalation checks, and penetration testing tools.
