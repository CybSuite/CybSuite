# CybSuite

## Introduction

> **Warning**
> This project is currently in Alpha stage and under active development. While core functionality is implemented and tested, the API and features may change significantly between versions.

**CybSuite** is a collection of security tools and scripts for penetration testing, configuration review, and reconnaissance. The following tools are available:

- **[cybs-db]**: A centralized database for penetration testing, configuration review, and security assessments. Features built-in ingestors for common security tools (Nmap, Masscan, Netexec, Bloodhound, etc.), passive vulnerability scanning capabilities, reporting capabilities, and a planned web interface.
- **[cybs-review]**: A framework for configuration review that performs post-analysis of extracted configurations. Currently working for Windows systems, with Linux support coming soon.
